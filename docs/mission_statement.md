# Why Amoveo


# Money

Without money it would be very difficult to buy things, because you probably don't have anything that the other person wants, so you can't pay.
Without money it would be hard to plan a retirement. Nothing you could buy will last as long as you will live.
Without money it is hard to have a job, because you have to keep renegotiating wages depending on what you are being paid in.
Money allows us to give prices to everything else. Once there are prices, then we can more accurately communicate our needs. If the price of oranges is higher in one region, then we know that they have a greater need for oranges, and we should ship the oranges to them.
A world without money would be very chaotic.

It is too dangerous to depend on a centralized institution to provide such a critical tool that we depend on for our survival.
The counterfeiters can't resist the allure of the printing press.
When they print money, they are robbing everyone, they are pushing us towards the chaotic money-free world.

When money flows from a centralized source, the resulting economy is filled with hierarchies and pyramids. Everyone is begging for handouts from the counterfeiters. In order to survive in this environment, you need a way to lobby the counterfeiters, and you need to be compliant with the rules that the counterfeiter's enforce. The most effective way to lobby and to meet compliance is by teaming up together into large centralized institutions.

When predators are around, fish form schools for safety.
When counterfeiters are around, humans form centralized institutions like corporations for safety.


# Derivatives are for insurance

Derivatives are a way to exchange money from one point in time for the value of something else at a different point in time.

These are the tools that allow us to take bigger risks, and efficiently and fairly share the rewards to protect everyone who participates.
They protect us from risk, so some individuals can participate in more profitable economic activities which would otherwise be too dangerous.

For example:
Derivatives and insurance are the key tool for helping subsistence farmers become cash crop farmers, which is an important economic step to end world poverty.
Without derivatives, a farmer who doesn't plant subsistence crops risks watching his children die the same year.
With derivatives, the farmer can grow more profitable cash crops, and his children are not at risk of starvation.
The more valuable cash crops gives the farmer and his family the opportunity to escape poverty.

This is a tool we need to thrive, and no one should have the power to take it away.


# Derivatives are for communicating future needs

Markets for goods is how people communicate their need for the goods right now.
Markets for derivatives is how people communicate their needs for goods across time. If the price of wheat futures is high in 6 months, then farmers can know to plan their farming to provide more wheat in 6 months for when the people will need it.

Using derivatives we can even communicate very precise needs, such as: "If politician X is elected, then 6 months later the price of food will be 10-times higher."
Keeping needs like this secret is unethical.
If a disaster is coming, then we need to know ahead so we can prepare, that way less people will suffer or die.

The current legal system outlaws almost all of these life-saving derivatives globally. 
Without derivatives, people can not accurately communicate their future needs.
Without derivatives the farmer doesn't know how many vegetables to plant of each variety, because he doesn't know how many vegetables people will need.
Without derivatives, we don't know if a politician will make decisions that result in millions of deaths.


# Restricting access to derivatives is how the elite maintain control.

The governments can't resist the allure of restricting access to derivatives and insurance. They do this to give themselves and their friends an economic advantage.
The people with access to derivatives can easily outcompete everyone else economically. Almost any business can be significantly improved with access to these financial tools.
Restricting access to these financial tools is part of how the elite maintain their control.


# Amoveo protects humanity

Amoveo is being built to create a world where everyone has access to these life-sustaining tools: money and derivatives.
